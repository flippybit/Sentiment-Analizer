",You can visit the hotel and be wowed by the artistry of the rooms, but if you come, you have to spend the night in a cold room. This is what this place is all about! The beauty of the rooms is secondary to the experience of spending the night in one. The anticipation, fear, excitement... and when all is done you will have an experience that you will remember forever. We stayed in the ice hotel for 2 nights. The first in a hot room and the second in a cold one. The hot room was very nice and clean. For the cold one we went all out and stayed in a cold suite with a warm bathroom. First let me explain a little bit. When you stay overnight in a cold room, the room is made of ice with only a bed and nothing else. If you need to use the bathroom, you have to walk to an adjacent"
", building that is warm. The building is a service center with coffee, showers, lockers, sauna and is staffed 24/7. You have access to your room after 6 PM. When you go to sleep, you leave your stuff in the service center and only take your thermal underwear, a cap and your sleeping bag. The sleeping bag is warm and it covers your head. You are also given a liner to use inside of the sleeping bag. I found the bed and sleeping bag to be confortable and once I overcame the excitement, I was able to get an excellent night sleep. The rooms are very dark. They wake you up in the morning. Our room was a suite so we had a hot bathroom with showers and we had our luggage with us. If you can afford it, this makes the stay very pleasant and does not change the experience of sleeping in the ice room. In my opinion, if you don’t stay in a suite with the warm bathroom, there is no point in staying on a art room or a basic ice room. Both are beautiful and at night you just sleep. During the day, you will have time to visit all the rooms and take pictures of them, you will not miss a thing. After finishing my Northern Lights trip, I would not have stayed at the Ice Hotel for two nights. There are a lot of activities, but I would have rather stayed at the Abisko Tourist Station an extra night to enjoy better scenery and similar activities in a less touristy environment. Don’t hesitate to spend a night here. It will be an experience to remember"
",This hotel absolutely doesn’t worth the hype. Actually the rooms , the cold rooms are visited during the day by visitors and during the night guests sleep in there . I mean it is even hygienic.Anyway I have been visiting the hotel for the ice sculptures. This year have been much better , but still some from the previous year.It is nice to visit during March month in a sunny day."
",We made the Icehotel tour back in February 2020 and enjoyed our time. It's a good activity to learn more about the Icehotel, see the great work of artists designing the rooms out of snice (snow and ice), take really cool pictures and enjoy a drink in the Icebar."
",Things like this are what memories are made of. Stayed here for two nights. One in an ice room,  the other in a warm room. The ice room experience was amazing. You are given a briefing before you stay which is v useful. I never felt cold during the night and had a good nights sleep. White Santorini, our room, was beautiful. The hotel has good facilities and you are fully kitted out for the weather. The chalet for the second night was v comfortable as well. The restaurants are both good with decent food but expensive. The walks around the hotel are super. We went husky sledding but with an independent company supplied by our holiday organiser Aurora Nights. Amazing!!!  This is something everyone should experience."
",What can I say, it’s the original ice hotel! This was part of a bucket list trip and we stayed two evenings in a “warm room” at the ice hotel. The staff was excellent during our entire stay, the hotel itself was nice to explore and see the different art exhibited in the ice rooms, nice gift shop and the restaurants on property was great. It’s also a great convenience that most tours will pick you up from the ice hotel and return you afterwards. Keep in mind that the ice hotel offers tours and excursions as well but I would forgo that and go with one offered by viotar or a off property company. You can save a lot of money for the same or even better experience."
",Staying in the Ice Hotel has been my wish for many years. When it finally came true, the expectations were high, but so was the uncertainty about many things. I will therefore try to make this review as informative as possible to help fellow travellers who plan to visit Jukkasjarvi in the future. Our arrival was late in the night, with one of two flights landing here daily from Stockholm. If you fly directly from your home country, it is very likely you will be on the same flight. We arranged a transportation with the hotel before the arrival. It was expensive (but everything there is) and we got a shared taxi. When there is more people (like on our way back), the hotel seems to arrange a bus. It is a 15-minute drive, so it doesn't really matter what you chose. Plenty of taxis"
",at the airport as well, but I would still advise to have one waiting for you. We chose to stay in the Ice hotel for the whole stay (as opposed to staying in Kiruna and just making a tour visit to the Ice hotel). I would definitely recommend that, since just having a one-hour tour isn't the real experience. We stayed for three nights (more than enough, especially if the weather is bad and you can do any outdoor activities). With the late arrival, staying in the ice room for the last night was a logical thing to do; I would do it regardless of the arrival time, simply to have a grande finale to the stay. The reception was efficient and we were soon heading to our ""warm room"". We got the basic one and it was nice: minimalistic Scandinavian design, no-thrills (no fridge, but who needs it in the polar weather; wifi was great), warm, and comfortable. Despite being in one of the most remote houses, it was only a very short walk away. The breakfast is held in the main restaurant building very close to the reception. It was not opulent, but the selection is fine, the quality of the items ok, and it was not that difficult to get a free table. As the weather was cloudy with a bit of snowfall, we spent the day making the only possible walk in Jukkasjarvi - from the hotel to the old church and back. There is a small supermarket on the way, so you can get all the snacks, drinks, and other supplies you might need there. The little church is nice to see (and you need five minutes to do it) and the nearby Sami cafe with its reindeers offers a nice light lunch. There is nothing else to see or do (again, if the weather is not nice) in the walking distance of the hotel. The hotel has a small souvenir shop. The selection is good, the prices are (of course) high; we were very dissapointed because they didn't have any postcards with Ice Hotel motifs on them (they had a set of 10, but only with photos of details in the hotel, not rooms, ice bar,…). We later managed to get them in Kiruna (a 50 EUR one way by taxi or 4 EUR/person each way by bus). We of course had a drink in the Ice Bar. To be honest, I expected much more of the place. Compared to how they decorated the rooms, the bar feels kind of empty. It was still a pleasant experience - drinking our G&T from ice glasses (about 15 EUR per drink), sitting on reindeer-covered ice blocks.  We had one dinner in each of hotel's restaurants (Homestead and the IceHotel restaurant; didn't decide to invest in the Veranda experience); I will write separate reviews for both of them. Summary: the Ice Hotel is not a culinary destination. And then to the main part, the purpose of the whole trip to Jukkasjarvi - the ice room. The first dilemma when booking was whether to take a regular room or an ice suite. The hotel (obviously intentionally) doesn't provide any guidance photos (in the 365 part, there are even rooms that you can only see if and when you book them and are not shown to the visitors) and made the choice even harder. Seeing both, I can say that the ice room exceeded my expectations. It is comparable in size, and the decor is nice (although much simpler); it reminded me of the Supermans' home with the giant crystals rising from the floor. With the surcharge of about 150 EUR per night, you get the ice suite. You can't chose which one at the time of the booking and you don't have any photos available, too. We decided to go for it and I don't regret the extra cost. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and with the 15 EUR GTs and 20 EUR sandwiches, the extra cost is not that high. What you get is a truly unique place to sleep in and to us it was worth it, despite the fact that you actually look at the room decor as the staying guest for perhaps 20 minutes before you turn the lights off. We managed to get some photos of the suites on the net and informed the hotel about our preferences. They made no promises and we finally didn't get our first choice. Not because they wouldn't give it to us, but because we chose another one. I suggest that you tour the hotel (as the guest you can do that free of charge throughout the day) and see which suite you like most (seeing it is completely different than seeing the photo). Then go to the reception and ask them to assign you that one. Do it early and you stand a high chance of success.   With the suite, you have one significant benefit: instead of a locker box, you get a locker room. It is more comfortable, with more storage space and, very important, gives you a safety mechanism in case the night would be too cold (it isn't) - come to the warm part and sleep on the bench in your locker room. As for the 365 part - I don't recommend it (at least not during the winter when you can stay at the ""real"" one); it just feels like sleeping in a huge freezer; to me, it lacked the natural feeling that you get in the winter version. Our big concern (and probably yours as well) was how cold it will actually be to sleep there. We prepared well: warm socks, skiing underwear, track suits, warm fleece, gloves, hat, scarf. It was too much. It gets very hot inside the sleeping bag designed for much lower temperature. Gloves were off in five minutes and we didn't feel cold throughout the night. It is still not a comfortable sleep, though. The air is cold and very dry. My 2-week flu just ended before the trip and the dry air in the room made me cough again. But the safe heaven with a fireplace, hot juice, toilets, etc. is just 20 steps away, which helps psychologically. When we woke up (they come and wake you up at 7:30, but I think most of the guests didn't wait for that), we thought that after going to the toilet, we would stay a bit longer in the room. Returning to the cold place, we packed and left. We got our experience. That concluded our stay and after the breakfast, we just had to wait (there is a lounge bar next to the reception) for the bus to take us to the airport. We loved the stay and staying in the ice suite was a beautiful and memorable experience. Once in a lifetime, and that is enough."
",Dear fellow travellers Its me again, Donald and my wife judith. we are back and better than ever on our christmas trip to the ICEHOTEL! we were greeted by the lovely Magnus who had a cheeky smirk upon arrival. i must say the hotel was magnificant and the staff were very jolly. The first thing my wife and I did was an ice sculpting class where we met Olafur who was an old fella with a missing tooth and bald (like an egg) we had a delightful yoga session with Ravi (our wonderful instructor) which was empowering and they played some opera which my wife LOVED (a bit too much) but i got a migraine. we were doing the downward dog pose and lets just say Ravi got a bit too touchy feely with judith for my liking but i think my harsh glare scared his botox face away. in the evenings it was bloody freezing but dont worry we wrapped up warm with my northface jacket whislt judith had her wooly hat from M&S. although i was a bit dissapointed in my jacket as i was still freezing so that will be taken back asap and i will get my £200 back. overall apart from the cheeky yogo instructor we had a wonderful time and i recommend to all."
",We stayed in a warm cabin, and it was cozy and comfortable. A perfect winter cabin. The Ice Hotel itself is stunning, with the individually sculpted rooms. My favorite rooms included Auris (201) and the one with the ice maze. Our child really enjoyed the ice slide. The restaurant was a bit of a letdown. While the pastries and salads were great, the green peppers tasted moldy and the grilled tomatoes and steamed fish were bland. All in all, a great experience nonetheless."
